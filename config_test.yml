# Important for understanding DANE configs: https://github.com/CLARIAH/DANE/blob/main/DANE/config.py
#   FIRST the home dir config is applied (~/.DANE/config.yml),
#   THEN the base_config.yml will overwrite anything,
#   THEN the local config.yml
#
# Therefore, we use:
# - For local testing: a local config.yml (copy based on this file)
# - In k8s mode: create a k8s ConfigMap (--from-file config.yml) and mount it in ~/.DANE/config.yml
#
# Note: it does not seem possible to mount a ConfigMap in the root dir of the worker, so
#       base_config.yml and config.yml are in .dockerignore (so they cannot overwrite ~/.DANE/config.yml)
#
# Note: For local testing, copy this file to config.yml (in main dir of this repo)
